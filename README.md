# ALX Low-Level Programming Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my low-level programming projects from the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, where I focused on mastering **C programming** and foundational **data structures and algorithms**. Through these projects, I’ve learned essential system-level programming concepts, memory management, and performance optimization techniques crucial for efficient software development. The repository demonstrates my progress and growth in using C to solve complex computational problems and implement core algorithms.

**Domains Explored**

  * **C Programming**: Building efficient code for system-level applications, covering basics to advanced topics like file I/O, dynamic memory management, and preprocessor directives.

  * **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implementing essential data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees; and studying algorithms for sorting, searching, and recursion.

  * **System Programming and Debugging**: Writing and debugging low-level code, utilizing libraries, and creating a basic shell to understand process handling.
