# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while 
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `C programming`

The project introduced me to python programming language. At the end of the project I created executable python 
files and basic functions to print text on the screen, which helped me understand basic python syntax.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

  * You can find the source code here
  * The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program
  * You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
  * The output of the program should be:
    * The number, followed by
      * if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
      * if the number is 0: `is zero`
      * if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    * followed by a new line

  * [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): C program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.

**1. The last digit**

This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

  * You can find the source code here
  * The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program
  * You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, and `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
  * The output of the program should be:
    * The string `Last digit of`, followed by
    * `n`, followed by
    * the string `is`, followed by
      * if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
      * if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
      * if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
      * followed by a new line
